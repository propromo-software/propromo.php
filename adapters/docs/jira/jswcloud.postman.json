Note, the last column with statuses mapped to it is treated as the \"Done\" column, which means that issues in that column will be marked as already completed.\n *  `estimation` (Scrum only) - Contains information about type of estimation used for the board.

Note, estimates for an issue can be updated by a PUT /rest/api/3/issue/\\{issueIdOrKey\\} request, however the fields must be on the screen. \"timeoriginalestimate\" field will never be on the screen, so in order to update it \"originalEstimate\" in \"timetracking\" field should be updated.\n *  `ranking` \\- Contains information about custom field used for ranking in the given board."
